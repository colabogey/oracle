/*
Magical Candy Bags
You have N bags of candy. The ith bag contains arr[i] pieces of candy, and each
of the bags is magical! It takes you 1 minute to eat all of the pieces of candy
in a bag (irrespective of how many pieces of candy are inside), and as soon as
you finish, the bag mysteriously refills. If there were x pieces of candy in the
bag at the beginning of the minute, then after you've finished you'll find that
floor(x/2) pieces are now inside. You have k minutes to eat as much candy as
possible. How many pieces of candy can you eat? Signature int maxCandies(int[]
arr, int K) Input 1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000 1 ≤ k ≤ 10,000 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000
Output
A single integer, the maximum number of candies you can eat in k minutes.
Example 1
N = 5
k = 3
arr = [2, 1, 7, 4, 2]
output = 14
In the first minute you can eat 7 pieces of candy. That bag will refill with
floor(7/2) = 3 pieces. In the second minute you can eat 4 pieces of candy from
another bag. That bag will refill with floor(4/2) = 2 pieces. In the third
minute you can eat the 3 pieces of candy that have appeared in the first bag
that you ate. In total you can eat 7 + 4 + 3 = 14 pieces of candy.
